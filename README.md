# 🚀 REST API Collection

This repository is a learning and reference collection of REST API projects. 
It is organized as a single mono‑repository that contains multiple independent REST API examples, each focused on a specific concept, technology, or architectural pattern.

The main goal of this repo is to:

* Practice building RESTful services in a clean, structured way

- Explore different approaches, tools, and best practices

+ Keep all training and demo APIs in one place for easy navigation and comparison

Each project is self‑contained, with its own configuration, dependencies, and documentation.
